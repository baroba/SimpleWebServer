Availability
With in the bounds of the testing that we did we where unable to crash the client with the given dos attacks.
performance
the lantency is slightly lower becuse we limit the number of threads that can be active at a time. the memory usage is much lower becuse of it. the through put has a sort of cap on it from the number of active threads at a time but it would only be a problem in large scall testing that we can't do
Security
We were not able to make the project fail with the testing that we did so that is pretty good security.
